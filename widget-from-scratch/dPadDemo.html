                To use in code just build a table! When constructing your rows, set their id equal to the row number (ex. row 1 id = 1) and the row class to "tRow". Give whatever row you want to start focus on the class "vertical-target" as well. Last, set the table class to "dpad-receiver" and you should be good to go!
